Edit Libraries/PythonPlugin/version.h with the correct plugin information there. This information will be used on installation.

Edit Libraries/PythonPlugin/PythonPlugin_27.vcxproj to use the correct Python version (unless it is already supplied in this package). Change any corresponding paths for Python as well.

Compile Libraries/PythonPlugin/PythonPlugin_27.vcxproj in Release (does not work in Debug).

Edit Examples/Python-Skeleton/info_27.xml with the correct plugin information there. This information will be used during runtime.

The file Examples/Python-Skeleton/MyPlugin.py is the Python plugin: edit this accordingly. If another file name shall be used, change the File reference in the info.xml.

Copy the following files to a separate directory "MyPlugin" (or run "copy_27.bat"):
	Libraries/PythonPlugin/Release/PythonPlugin_27.dll
	Libraries/PyPlugin.DataTypes/* (all files)
	Examples/Python-Skeleton/info_27.xml
	Examples/Python-Skeleton/MyPlugin.xml
	C:/Windows/SysWOW64/Python27.dll

Zip the files to "MyPlugin.zip" and then change the name of the file to "MyPlugin.dcext".

There are different Python versions already supplied in this package. If you add support for a different version, be sure to add all of the aforementioned files, too, since it will greatly help you and others.
